I come here to dance in the party lights
Making all the right moves, it's my night
Gotta get you off my mind
So decide again for one more night
I can feel the passion burning hot

Visions of you weep in my every move
Yeah, the beat's in to steal me away from you
You've been working overtime (overtime)
So I had to read between the lines
Gotta find someone special (special this time)

I just dance all night
To break away from you
I gotta keep moving (I gotta keep moving)
I just dance all night
And when the evening's through
I'll be in the groove (groove)
Whoo, ha!

I keep on moving to the rhythm of the beat, 'cause
I keep on moving to the rhythm of the beat, 'cause
The beat won't back off

Danced to no better groove, in my life
Play the song so I can party one more night
You can see it wasn't right
So it's up to me to draw the line
Gotta find new passion, bring it on

I just dance all night
To break away from you
I gotta keep moving (I gotta keep moving)
I just dance all night (oh, I dance all night)
And when the evening's through
I'll be grooving (I'll be grooving)
I just dance all night
To break away from you
I gotta keep moving (I gotta keep moving, grooving)
I just dance all night (oh, I dance all night)
And when the evening's through
I'll be in the groove
The groove, groove...

(Rap):
You're all right
Every time I fall in love with you
Another girl needs your loving too
I stay out all night
And the dance will make it alright
Every time I fall in love with you
Another girl needs your loving too
I stay out all night
And the dance will make it alright

I'll be grooving
I just dance all night (dance)
To break away from you
I gotta keep moving (I gotta keep moving)
I just dance all night (dance, dance)
And when the evening's through
I'll be grooving (I'll be grooving)
I just dance all night (dance) (oh, I dance all night)
To break away from you
I gotta keep moving (I gotta keep moving, grooving)
I just dance all night (dance, dance)
And when the evening's through
I'll be grooving
I just dance all night (dance) (I can feel the beat)
To break away from you
I gotta keep moving (I can feel the beat...)
I just dance all night (dance, dance) (I just dance all night long)
And when the evening's through
I'll keep moving on ('cause I'll keep moving on)
I just dance all night (dance)
To break away from you
I gotta keep moving
I just dance all night (no more idle playing around)
(Never gonna bring me down)
I just dance all night (dance, dance)
And when the evening's through
(Don't you know that life's so real)
I'll be grooving...
